Richard Feynman was a physicist who received a nobel prize for his work in quantum electrodynamics. He was notorious for asking his mathematicians to explain concepts in simple language to test their understanding.   

His approach towards understanding a concept is rather usefu. Here is an animation on how his approach works.
